2	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	The best phone I have purchased so far. The best  display ,the best camera ,super light and super smooth.It feels like butter.But there is a slight heating issue .Akg headphone is really nice.	Simply awesome	0.5599999999999998	\N
3	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	The device gets heated up in just about anything like opening websites on Chrome, Facebook, video calls, in fact just about anything. Battery drains like anything along with that. Forget playing heavy games. I was using a one plus 5t which was 2.5 years old and that device performed better than this. Hugely disappointed, had spent a lot of money for this. If someone can suggest how to contact Samsung for this, please let me know. Samsung members seems useless.	Utterly Disappointed	-0.24285714285714288	\N
4	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	I upgraded to Sasung S20 after using Samsung S9 for more than a year and that is the reason why I love this so much because I am very aware of it's capabilities.Trust me, it's worth the upgrade. Great hardware and software, and the feeling of being owning the latest flagship is unbeatable. I am using this along with Galaxy buds+ and Gear fit2 combo, and I am more than satisfied with it.I am one of those people who are constantly on their phone throughout the day, and one reason why I love...	Brilliant	0.4604166666666667	\N
5	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	Easily the best compact phone with all the essential features. Everything right from the display, sound quality, network speed is being dealt with the utmost accuracy from Samsung. Loved the phone and i give 10/10 based on my experience so far.	Classy product	0.3773809523809523	\N
6	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	I should say well come back samsung the mobile is stunning simple wow the performance battery camera and the most important screen if you love playing games its butter smooth to handle the screen refresh rate makes even awesome device Fantastic made the original flagship phone is here guys if you have any plans to buy s20 go ahead its wonderful buy never turn back simple awesome mobile.	Excellent	0.44843750000000004	\N
7	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	This is a SUPER PHONE, with some shortcomings as with every superhero..This the perfect size for a smartphone. The regular S20 should be the benchmark for the mobile industry.The phone is slim and tall, but conveniently narrow to hold in one hand comfortably.Coming to display, although the 120hz refresh rate is gorgeous to look and feel, its a battery hogger. Even with 60hz, I am not getting through the day. I hope the battery backup improves once the software learns the usage pattern, f...	Awesome Super Phone	0.4523809523809523	\N
8	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	If there is any good thing that 2020 gave is Samsung Galaxy S20...I upgraded  from Samsung Galaxy S9 to Samsung s20 and I am loving it.....ProsLovely screenA perfect sizeExcellent cameraSwift Performance...lag free Excellent user interface ConsThe fingerprint scanner is good but not excellentBattery Performance is average..

9	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	Good phone. But for some reason I loved my old s8 than this mobile. But this mobile have very good battery life	Pretty good	0.5599999999999999	\N
10	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	The phone gets overheated very quickly, like the refresh rate drops from 120Hz to 60Hz even if I just open the camera app for a few minutes.The phones gets heated even if I just put it for charge.I've read many good reviews about this phone and it's battery life, but looks like most of it is because of the Snapdragon 865. Apart from the cons, this phone has a killer display. 120Hz refresh rate is like buttery smooth. There's no going back to 60Hz once you get used to this.	Absolute rubbish!	0.28703703703703703	\N
11	MOBFZXZ2RNFPRFGV	Premium phone. Initially phone used to get hot but after an update heating issue is solved. About display Samsung screen is stunning and this is no exception. Amazing display and coupled with 120hz screen it is treat to use this. And about performance it is not at the level of 865 but it is more powerful than 855+. In benchmark it scores above 5lakhs. And there is no game or app in the playstore which this processor cannot handle. Yes in long sessions of game play it gets warm but it's nothin...	Best in the market!	0.2916666666666667	\N
